        <h5 style="margin: auto" align="center">Brent got a boomerang for his birthday when he was 11. He was excited to try it out, so his dad took him to the park near their house. It was a warm day with a few clouds, and only a little wind. They went to the clearing between four baseball diamonds, which was about 100 yards from the closest trees. He took the boomerang and threw it as hard as he could! They watched with excitement as the boomerang stayed aloft, and began to turn through the sky. The excitement turned to panic as he realized that while his throw gave the boomerand a lot of speed, the speeding boomerang was coming right back at him! </h5>

        <h5 style="margin: auto" align="center">This is a memory that can be recreated in virtual reality to give others that same experience. Your task is to do this very thing with a memory of your own! Think of an event in your life that involved something moving - dodging out of the way of a car, playing dodgeball, dropping an icecream, or whatever you can think of.</h5>

    <div class="row" style="margin-bottom: 20px">
        <h3 style="margin: auto" align="center">Create the setting for your memory. Add as much detail as possible to make the experience immersive. More detail is better, even if it isn't completely factual detail for the memory (e.g. you might not remember the type of furniture in a room, but making a detailed table will have a better effect than skipping a table altogether).</h3>

        <h3 style="margin: auto" align="center">Animate the object to recreate your memory. Animate any other parts that are necessary to make the scene realistic. AT LEAST 3 objects total should be animated in your scene - but again, more detail is better. </h3>
